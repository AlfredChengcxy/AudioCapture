tinyalsa: a small library to interface with ALSA in the Linux kernel

# The aims are

- Provide a basic pcm and mixer API
- If it's not absolutely needed, don't add it to the API
- Avoid supporting complex and unnecessary operations that could be
  dealt with at a higher level

# Features
- sample value of -650~650 is ignored.
- every file saves a serial audio.
- real-time record serial audio and generate a audio file which was named by number.
